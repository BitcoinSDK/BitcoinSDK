# 🎮 BitcoinSDK
<b>API for accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments. Easy, instant, fully automated.</b>

## 🌴 Easy
Now you don't need to set up your own Bitcoin payment infrastructure or use any other expensive services. Setting up is very easy and needs to be done only once.

## 🌿 Lowest cost in the market (0%)
We charge you <code>0%</code> and only <code>0.00017500 BTC/transaction</code>. Fee is flat and fixed.

## ⚡️ Instant
We detect the payment immediately once it hits the Bitcoin network. By default we notify (via callback) 2 times:
- when transaction with BTC payment to your address appears in Bitcoin blockchain mempool (unconfirmed, 0 confirmations)
- when transaction with BTC payment to your address gets 1 confirmation.

Zero confirmation delivery is suitable for digital goods such as subscriptions, which can be cancelled by you later if transaction with payment to your address didn't confirm.

## 🌒 Fully automated
Once you set the API connection, it works on it's own.

## 💚 Friendly support
Support is provided by the <b>owner of the service</b> to every client in need. Just drop me a message via <b>Telegram</b>.
