# 🎮 BitcoinSDK
<b>API for accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments. Easy, instant, fully automated.</b>

## Easy
🌴 Now you don't need to set up your own Bitcoin payment infrastructure or use any other expensive services. Setting up is very easy and needs to be done only once.

## Lowest cost in the market
🌿 We charge you <code>0%</code> and only <code>0.00015 BTC/transaction</code>. Fee is flat and fixed forever.

## Instant
⚡️ We detect the payment immediately once it hits the Bitcoin network. By default we notify (via callback) 2 times:
- when transaction with BTC payment to your address appears in Bitcoin blockchain mempool (unconfirmed, 0 confirmations)
- when transaction with BTC payment to your address gets 1 confirmation.

Zero confirmation delivery is suitable for digital goods such as subscriptions, which can be cancelled by you later if transaction with payment to your address didn't confirm.

## Fully automated
🌒 Once you set the API connection, it works on it's own.

## Friendly support
💚 Support is provided by the <b>owner of the service</b> to every client in need. Just drop me a message via <b>Telegram</b>.
